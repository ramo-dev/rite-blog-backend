# Getting Started with Flask Backend for Vite and Nx Pipeline

This project includes a Flask backend that serves as the API for a blog application, designed to work seamlessly with the front end built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Nx](https://nx.dev/) monorepo pipeline.

## Backend Setup

Follow the steps below to set up and run the Flask backend.

### 1. Clone the Backend Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rite-blog-backend.git
cd rite-blog-backend
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3. Run the Flask Server
```bash
python app.py
The backend server should now be running at http://localhost:5000.
```

Frontend Integration
To integrate this backend with the frontend, follow the instructions provided in the Vite and Nx Pipeline Frontend README repository.

Make sure to replace "https://github.com/your-username/rite-blog-backend.git" in the frontend README with the actual URL of your backend repository. This modification ensures clear instructions on setting up and running the Flask backend alongside the React frontend.
